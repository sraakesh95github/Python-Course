Homework 5 is to solve three ordinary differential equations. For each equation, solve it for the range 0-7, with 700 data points. Use the python function odeint! (For reference, see verysimpleODE.py and some of the other examples.)

You will turn in a single python file called hw5.py which solves the three problems. For each problem graph the requested items. Note that y' is the first derivative of y with respect to t. Likewise, y" is the second derivative of y with respect to t. Note that np.cos() and np.sin() are computing values in radians.

Problem 1: y’ = cos(t); initial value: y(0)=1. Plot y vs t. Since this is easily solvable, you know what the answer is so you should be able to refine your technique with this problem.

Problem 2: y’ = -2y + (2t+1)*np.exp(-2t); initial value y(0) = 0. Plot y vs t.

Problem 3: y” = -28cos(2t) + 3sin(2t)– 3y’ + y; initial values y(0) = 2, y’(0) = -6. Plot y vs t and y’ vs t on the same plot.
